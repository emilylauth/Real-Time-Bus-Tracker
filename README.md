# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description 

This is a week 9 coding project in the MIT xPRO Full Stack Web Development Course. It runs an animation of a marker representing all of the bus stops in between MIT and Harvard.

## Installation

Download the following files:
1. style.css
2. index.html
3. mapanimation.js

## Roadmap
I'm having the marker move every 2 seconds instead of one to allow the user more time to see each stop.
